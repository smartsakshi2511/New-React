                        <p>Cookies are very small text files, usually consisting of letters and numbers, that are saved
                            on your computer (or other devices such as a smartphone or tablet) via browsers by the
                            websites you visit. Cookies do not contain personal data about visitors such as name, gender
                            or address</p>
                    <p>Cookies are created by the servers that manage the website you visit. This way, the server
                            can understand when the visitor visits the same site. Cookies can be likened to ID cards
                            that show website owners that the same visitor has visited the site again.</p>
